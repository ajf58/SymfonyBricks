# SymfonyBricks

This is the public code repository of the entire website [symfonybricks.com](http://symfonybricks.com).

## Purpose

__[symfonybricks.com](http://symfonybricks.com)__ wants to be a website built by the community for the community.

The purpose is to create an open source platform containing a repository of code snippets and guides related to Symfony and submitted by users.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [in the doc/ folder](https://github.com/inmarelibero/SymfonyBricks/tree/master/doc): it's the main source of information regarding how SymfonyBrics works, discussions, drafts, etc... You are invited to spend some time on it and to contribute, tweaking doc it is a very very important task.

[Read the documentation](doc/index.md)


## Philosophy of symfonybricks.com

When a developer (eg: you) has to face a difficult task for him/her, a common behavior should be (before spending *x* hours multiplied by *3*) searching on internet if someone (more or less in order) already resolved that problem, or resolved a similar problem, or wrote something requiring help and someone other helped him.

Many times you found useful information, but it is often fragmentary, put in very different places and not consistent regarding the format. In one word: __not organic__.


The philosophy of __[symfonybricks.com](http://symfonybricks.com)__ follows two binaries:

1. provide a repository of publicly shared:
    - recipes
    - code snippets
    - cookbooks
    - suggestions
    - help requests
    - ... (what more?)

2. leave the development of the entire platform to the community


__[symfonybricks.com](http://symfonybricks.com)__, as well as containing many cool snippets of great code, wants to be itself an example of Symfony best practices. And more: __the entire platform serves and is created by the community with an open-source philosophy__, the same that distinguishes Symfony. If you are a Symfony lover, you should be definitively interested in symfonybricks.com!

## Who is behind symfonybricks.com

The repository mantainer is me, inmarelbero [(twitter)](https://github.com/inmarelibero). I'm a Symfony lover and had this idea, simply.

This project may have been started for fun, but I think I'm not the only one having fun with Symfony.
