# Dictionary

To talk about SymfonyBricks in this docs and in github issues, it's useful to define a homogeneous dictionary.

**[index](index.md) / Dictionary**

- [User](#user)
- [Brick](#brick)
- [Tag](#tag)

### User

A **user** is a person who registered on [symfonybricks.com](http://symfonybricks.com); he owns an account and a reserved area.

He can create **bricks** and manage the ones he owns (a user owns a **brick** he created).


### Brick

A **brick** is the foundamental component of SymfonyBricks: it can be a guide, a recipe, a cookbook, a commented piece of code, etc.. 

**Bricks** are created by a **user**; the **user** who creates a **brick** becomes his owner.

The syntax format is the same used by github: markdown.

It is possible to translate a **brick** in different languages.

### Tag

A **tag** can be composed by one or more words. The **user** who creates a **brick** can attach zero or more **tags** to it.
