# Roadmap

ATTENTION: this file is obsolete

This is a (very) raw guideline about the SymfonyBricks development roadmap.

Current state is: [2.x](https://github.com/inmarelibero/SymfonyBricks/blob/master/ROADMAP.md#2x---brick-creation)

## 2.x - Brick creation

Users can create bricks, manage and publish them.


## 1.x - Forkable project

The SymfonyBricks code must be downloadable by a user, who can create a local working copy following the documentation.

### 1.1 - Users can sign in

At this stage, users can register and sign in by integrating FOSUserBundle. Only canonical sign in is supported, no bridges with github, facebook, twitter etc.. are supported.
