# Roadmap

This is a (very) raw guideline about the SymfonyBricks development roadmap.

Current state is: [1.0](https://github.com/inmarelibero/SymfonyBricks/blob/master/ROADMAP.md#10---forkable-project)

## 1.0 - Forkable project
The SymfonyBricks code must be downloadable by a user, who can create a local working copy following the documentation.

## 1.1 - Users can sign in

At this stage, users can register and sign in by integrating FOSUserBundle. Only canonical sign in is supported, no bridges with github, facebook, twitter etc.. are supported.
